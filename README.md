# Introduction

In this project, I developed a dashboard for "Toman Bike Share" that displays key performance metrics to facilitate informed decision-making. Additionally, based on our analysis, I recommend raising prices next year. Our analysis encompasses the following aspects:

•	Hourly revenue analysis

•	Profit & revenue trends

•	Seasonal revenue

•	Ride demographics

# My Data Analysis Workflow

1.	Create a database
   
2.  Develop SQL queries
   
3. 	Connect powerBI to database
   
4. 	Build a dashboard in powerBI
  
5. 	Answer the analysis question

# About the Dataset: 
We have three distinct datasets. One contains information for Toman Bike Share for the year 2021, another for the year 2022.

Additionally, we have a dataset that includes the cost table, detailing the prices and costs of goods and services.

# Data transformation

In this project, I performed data transformation using SQL to query and combine data before loading it into Power BI for visualization. 
The diagram below illustrates my SQL queries prior to loading the data into Power BI for visualization.

Finally, after loading the data from the database into Power BI, I created this interactive dashboard to display key performance metrics.

# Findings

1. 

 
# Recommendation
**1.	Conservative Increase:** Given last year's significant price hike, a more modest increase this year would be wise to avoid reaching a price point that deters customers. A 10-15% increase would allow for a market test without jeopardizing a substantial loss of sales.

**2. Price Setting:**

- If the 2022 price was $4.99, a 10% boost would bring it to around $5.49.
- A 15% increase would put the new price at approximately $5.74.
  
**3. Market Analysis:** Conduct additional market research to gauge customer satisfaction, potential competitor moves, and the broader economic landscape. This will help determine whether to opt for a lower or higher price increase within the suggested range.

**4. Segmented Pricing Strategy:** Consider implementing tiered pricing for casual and registered users, as they may have different sensitivities to price changes.

**5. Monitor and Adjust:** Introduce the new prices but be prepared to make adjustments based on immediate customer feedback and sales data. Close monitoring will enable fine-tuning of the pricing strategy without fully committing to a potentially unsustainable price point.
